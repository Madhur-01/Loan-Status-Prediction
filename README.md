# Loan-Status-Prediction-
In this project I analysied various Machine Learning algorithms to predict loan status of a new applicant using various background informations about the applicant.Parameters like credit score, loan amount, lifestyle, career, income and assets are the deciding factors in getting the loan approval.

Several collections of data from past loan applicants use different features to decide the loan status. A machine learning model can look at this data, which could be static or time-series, and give a probability estimate of whether this loan will be approved.

For this project, we choose the dataset from the Loan Prediction Competition on Kaggle. It has 12 features, one target variable, and 614 samples. The features include Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependents, and others. This straightforward dataset will be a good measure of finding which ML models work the best.
